**What are the essentials of a Software that is used in mostly stressfull & possibly chaotic contexts?** That's the question we've been researching in contact with different dedicated people, conducting interviews about different needs, thinking about different scenarios and different possible types of users. 

**Also we asked chatGPT about the most important needs of disaster responders that concludes:**

        - Safety: The safety of responders is paramount in any disaster situation. Responders must be present, alert and alert at all times.
        - Communication: Communication is crucial to coordination and collaboration among responders to ensure effective response.
        - Food and Water: Responders need to have food and hydration throughout the disaster response effort.
        - Shelter: Adequate shelter is essential to ensure that responders stay healthy and perform at their best.
        - Medical Care: Responders need to be treated for injury or illness that may occur during the disaster response effort.
        - Logistics: Effective support logistics must be in place to provide the response team with essentials such as transportation, power and sanitation.
        - Mental health support: Responders should have access to mental health care to deal with the trauma and challenges of the disaster response effort.


**Our answer:** 
Food and water, of course, we can't provide that with software. But dear users: don't forget to eat and drink! 
Security: We translate it with security and it is a core part of FormsWizard. We have put a lot of know-how into the secure data management aspect. 
As for the other needs: we hope that through FormsWizard the communities out there will be able to connect, organize and structure their communication, capacities and forces more easily.
