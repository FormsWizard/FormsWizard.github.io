## **Intro**
**What are the essentials of a Software that is used in mostly stressfull & possibly chaotic contexts?** That's the question we've been researching in contact with different dedicated people, conducting interviews about different needs, thinking about different scenarios and different possible types of users. We have summarized the results of the research in a set of different fictional users, you can find them <u>[here](https://github.com/FormsWizard/formswizard/wiki/ideas:___persona)</u>[not active] in our documentation on GitHub.

**ChatGPT concludes about the most important needs of disaster responders:**

        - Safety: The safety of responders is paramount in any disaster situation. Responders must be present, alert and alert at all times.
        - Communication: Communication is crucial to coordination and collaboration among responders to ensure effective response.
        - Food and Water: Responders need to have food and hydration throughout the disaster response effort.
        - Shelter: Adequate shelter is essential to ensure that responders stay healthy and perform at their best.
        - Medical Care: Responders need to be treated for injury or illness that may occur during the disaster response effort.
        - Logistics: Effective support logistics must be in place to provide the response team with essentials such as transportation, power and sanitation.
        - Mental health support: Responders should have access to mental health care to deal with the trauma and challenges of the disaster response effort.



These points grasp some of the surrounding factors that make any engagement work out in a better way. Food and water, of course, we can't provide with software - [Dear Users: don't forget to eat and drink! :-)].

**Security:**  We translate safety with security and it is a core part of FormsWizard. We have put a lot of know-how into a secure data management architecture [security by design]. 

**And for the other needs:** We hope that through FormsWizard the communities out there will be able to connect, organize and structure their communication and capacities more easily.
