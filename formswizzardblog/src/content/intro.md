formsWizard <br /> is an open source tool under development that supports
        civic engagement in data management. In civic organizing contexts. There
        are usually few resources and a lot of structure is needed to pool the collected
        energy. With formsWizard, we aim to support crews in various use cases to
        collect and evaluate the data they need. In times of increasing crises, not
        only in face of the climate catastrophe, we see the necessity of civic engagement
        .
        <br />
        In developing the formsWizard project, our focus is on independence in development
        [it's all open source], customizability [we see the broad spectrum of civic
        engagement], and consideration of safety aspects.
