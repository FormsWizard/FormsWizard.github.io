## Intro

What are the essentials of a Software that is used in mostly stressfull & possibly chaotic contexts?
We asked chatGPT: What are the most important needs for people helping in catastrophes?

Safety: The safety of responders is paramount in any disaster situation. Responders must be present, alert and alert at all times.
Communication: Communication is crucial to coordination and collaboration among responders to ensure effective response.
Food and Water: Responders need to have food and hydration throughout the disaster response effort.
Shelter: Adequate shelter is essential to ensure that responders stay healthy and perform at their best.
Medical Care: Responders need to be treated for injury or illness that may occur during the disaster response effort.
Logistics: Effective support logistics must be in place to provide the response team with essentials such as transportation, power and sanitation.
Mental health support: Responders should have access to mental health care to deal with the trauma and challenges of the disaster response effort.


Food & Water: We cannot provide that with software of course. But dear users: Don't forget to drink and eat!
Safety: We translate it with security. And yes, a core part of FormsWizard lays on the aspect of secure data management.
Regarding the other needs: We hope that through FormsWizard the communities out there can more easily connect, organize and structure their communication, capacities and powers. <3
