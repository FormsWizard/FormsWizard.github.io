## Intro

What are the essentials of a Software that is used in mostly stressfull & possibly chaotic contexts? That is the question that we were researching in contact with different engaged people, had interviews on different needs, thought about different scenarios and different possible usere characters.
But also we asked chatGPT: What are the most important needs for people helping in catastrophes?

- Safety: The safety of responders is paramount in any disaster situation. Responders must be present, alert and alert at all times.
- Communication: Communication is crucial to coordination and collaboration among responders to ensure effective response.
- Food and Water: Responders need to have food and hydration throughout the disaster response effort.
- Shelter: Adequate shelter is essential to ensure that responders stay healthy and perform at their best.
- Medical Care: Responders need to be treated for injury or illness that may occur during the disaster response effort.
- Logistics: Effective support logistics must be in place to provide the response team with essentials such as transportation, power and sanitation.
- Mental health support: Responders should have access to mental health care to deal with the trauma and challenges of the disaster response effort.


Food & Water: We cannot provide that with software of course. But dear Users: Don't forget to drink and eat!
Safety: We translate it with security and it is a core part of FormsWizard. We put a lot of expertise on the aspect of secure data management.
Regarding the other needs: We hope that through FormsWizard the communities out there can more easily connect, organize and structure their communication, capacities and powers. <3
