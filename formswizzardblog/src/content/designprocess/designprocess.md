We continued the exchange with the AI asking:
**What are the best colors to design a supportive interface for an use in human disaster management?**

When designing an interface for human disaster management, use colors with elements of safety and caution. Here are a few best practices for color selection:

         - Use shades of blue to provide a calming effect that will evoke a sense of safety and trust.
            - Consider using red sparingly for high priority alerts and pressing situations; too much can incite panic and anxiety.
         - Yellow is ideal for highlighting important information, especially when paired with a neutral color like white or gray.
         - Green can be used to indicate safety or progress, signifying that certain areas have been cleared or are under control.
         - Avoid brighter colors such as neon or hot pink, as these colors may distract from the message and be deemed unprofessional.
         - Ultimately, the color scheme you choose should be easily readable and visibly distinguishable to quickly communicate important information during a disaster.
