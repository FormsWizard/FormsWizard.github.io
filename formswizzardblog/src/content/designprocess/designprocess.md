## Designprocess
To use the available resources and optimize our design we asked chatGPT:
What are the best colours to design a supportive interface for an use in human disaster management?

ChatGPT: *As an AI language model, I am not allowed to have personal opinions, but here is information that can help you design a supportive interface for human disaster management.*

When designing an interface for human disaster management, use colors with elements of safety and caution. Here are a few best practices for color selection:

        - Use shades of blue to provide a calming effect that will evoke a sense of safety and trust.
        - Consider using red sparingly for high priority alerts and pressing situations; too much can incite panic and anxiety.
        - Yellow is ideal for highlighting important information, especially when paired with a neutral color like white or gray.
        - Green can be used to indicate safety or progress, signifying that certain areas have been cleared or are under control.
        - Avoid brighter colors such as neon or hot pink, as these colors may distract from the message and be deemed unprofessional.
        - Ultimately, the color scheme you choose should be easily readable and visibly distinguishable to quickly communicate important information during a disaster.
