          forms_Wizard is an open source tool under development that supports
          civic engagement in data management. <br /> <br /> 
        </h1>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">In civic organizing contexts
          there are usually few resources and a lot of structure is needed to
          pool the collected energy. With forms_Wizard, we aim to support crews
          in various use cases to collect and evaluate the data they need. In
          times of increasing crises, not only in face of the climate
          catastrophe, we see the necessity of civic engagement.
          <br />
          <br />
          In developing the forms_Wizard project, our focus is on independence in
          development [it's all open source], customizability [we see the broad spectrum
          of civic engagement], and consideration of safety aspects.
